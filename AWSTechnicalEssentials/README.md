VPC Main Concepts

What is an IPaddress?

Subnet
A subnet, or subnetwork, is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The process of dividing a network into subnets is called subnetting. Subnets are used to make networks more efficient by reducing the distance that network traffic has to travel

Route Table
In computer networking, a routing table, or routing information base, is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics associated with those routes.

A set of rules called routes is used to decided network traffic direction

DCP option sets
A DHCP option set is a group of network settings used by resources in your VPC, such as EC2 instances, to communicate over your virtual network.

Security Groups
Virtual Firewall. The moment you add the inbound rules the outbound rule is applied

Network access control
Internet Gateway
A gateway to allow interaction between VPC  resoures and the internet

NAT Gateway
Entity that allows your private instances to talk to the internet.
